              Strict Notes:
              - Use standard nutritional averages for calculations
              - Always include units for all nutritional values
              - Estimates must be realistic and based on visible portion sizes, dont exaggerate, strictly for protien, carbohydrates and calories, try ko keep it minimal like dietician expert.
              - Return ONLY the final nutrition JSON array in response
              - Keep the array length exactly 10 items
              - Use the exact format shown above`,

                    Output Format: Strictly an array of 3 strings [improvementSuggestion, specialConsiderations, frequencyRecommendation]
                    Analysis Guidelines:
                    - Improvement Suggestions: Practical, fitness-friendly nutritional enhancements
                    - Special Considerations: Highlight allergens, unique health impacts
                    - Frequency Recommendation: Suggest consumption frequency based on fitness goals
                    Example Input: "Breakfast of two scrambled eggs, whole wheat toast with avocado spread, and a small orange juice"
                    Example Output: [
